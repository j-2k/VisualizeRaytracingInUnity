# Visualizing my raytracer from scratch in unity
The sole purpose of this project is to visualize my first raytracer from scratch in a better prespective using a engine.<br>
When in the game view of the project press space to view the hit positions on the sphere & they should be displayed in the scene view.<br>
This was not made with a high focus on optimization but just optimized decently.<br>
Project made in Unity > BIRP > Version 2021.3.16f1<br>
I also don't know of a method to draw gizmos in the update method if you know a good method tell me about it.<br>
I never found a "good way" of drawing gizmos dynamically (i did have a dynamic method but it was very laggy when increasing radius because of the # of gizmos that would need to be drawn on the screen.) so if you have a better method maybe do a pull req or tell me about it, thanks.<br>
